## 🎮 About the Game

**Blueth Farm** is a cozy coastal restoration simulator where you inherit your grandmother's degraded coastal property and transform it into a thriving blue carbon ecosystem. Plant seagrasses, restore salt marshes, grow mangrove forests, and watch as your efforts sequester carbon, protect the coastline, and revive a struggling fishing community.

### Key Features

🌱 **Restore Five Unique Ecosystems**
- Seagrass meadows
- Salt marshes
- Mangrove forests
- Kelp forests
- Deep ocean habitats

📊 **Living Carbon Dashboard**
- Track CO₂ sequestered in real-time
- Sell verified carbon credits
- See real-world impact equivalencies

🌊 **Dynamic Tidal & Seasonal Systems**
- Real tidal cycles affect planting and accessibility
- Seasonal changes influence species migration and storms
- Lunar cycles trigger spawning events

🦀 **Ecosystem & Biodiversity Management**
- Attract 100+ species of marine life
- Build food web resilience
- Document species in your scientific codex

🏘️ **Community & Economy**
- Build relationships with six core NPCs
- Invest in town infrastructure
- Develop sustainable eco-tourism
- Navigate political challenges

🔬 **Research & Tech Tree**
- Four branches: Ecology, Engineering, Policy, Culture
- Learn from grandmother's journal
- Unlock traditional ecological knowledge

⏰ **40-60 Hour Story + Endless Legacy Mode**
- Complete 5-year narrative arc
- Unlock sandbox mode
- Compete on global carbon leaderboards

## 🎨 Visual Style

Stylized 2D isometric art with hand-painted aesthetics. Think **Spiritfarer meets Stardew Valley** — warm, welcoming, scientifically grounded, and beautiful.

- **Color Palette:** Ocean blues, lush greens, warm golden hour lighting
- **Art Direction:** Watercolor UI, driftwood frames, nature-inspired design
- **Animation:** Fluid water, swaying vegetation, wildlife with personality

---

## 🌍 Grounded in Real Science

Every mechanic is based on peer-reviewed blue carbon science:

- **Seagrass meadows:** ~138 tonnes CO₂/km²/year
- **Salt marshes:** ~218 tonnes CO₂/km²/year
- **Mangrove forests:** ~226 tonnes CO₂/km²/year
- **Kelp forests:** Variable export-based sequestration

Learn real ecology, conservation, and climate science through engaging gameplay. A portion of game sales will fund actual coastal restoration projects.
