		"text": "Ah, there you are! I've been waiting for you. Let me tell you about these waters. When I was young, you couldn't walk ten feet without stepping on a crab. Now?

		"text": "Alright, here's how it works: Press 2 to equip your Seed Bag, then click on any shallow water tile to plant. The seagrass will grow over time—give it a few days. Once it's established, you'll start seeing the difference.",
