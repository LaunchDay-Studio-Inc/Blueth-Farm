codex_entry = "Laminaria, known as kombu in Asian cuisine, is a genus of brown algae cultivated for food and alginates. Unlike giant kelp, it grows to modest heights (1-3m) but forms dense underwater forests that support diverse marine life. Its fast growth and edibility make it valuable both ecologically and economically. The holdfasts attach to rocky substrate, and the blades sway with ocean currents."
