Today I learned something that will change everything.

I was collecting sediment cores from the old seagrass bed—what's left of it anyway—when I noticed something peculiar. The sediment beneath the plants was dark, almost black, and smelled of ancient earth. Nothing like the pale sand around it. I sent samples to the lab on a hunch.

The results came back this morning. That dark sediment? It's nearly 40% organic carbon. Carbon that's been locked away for centuries, maybe millennia. And it's not going anywhere—the anaerobic conditions down there prevent decomposition.

Do you understand what this means? These underwater meadows aren't just habitat for fish. They're not just erosion control or water filters. They're time capsules. Carbon vaults. Every blade of eelgrass photosynthesizes, pulling CO₂ from the atmosphere, and when it dies, that carbon gets buried in the sediment below. Year after year, century after century, building a bank of captured carbon.

I did the math. A single square kilometer of healthy seagrass can sequester 138 tonnes of CO₂ per year. That's equal to 35 cars driven for a year. And it stores it permanently—or at least for thousands of years, which might as well be permanent by human standards.

We've been looking for climate solutions in all the wrong places. Or rather, we've been ignoring the solutions that were here all along, hidden beneath the waves.

Tomorrow I start my first experimental restoration plot. Five square meters of eelgrass transplants. It's not much, but every meadow starts with a single seed.

The ocean has been fighting climate change for free this whole time. We just need to let it do its job."
