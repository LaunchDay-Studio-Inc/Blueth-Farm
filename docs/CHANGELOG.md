- Educates players about coastal ecosystems and climate change
- Creates a satisfying core loop of restoration and visible transformation
- Supports real-world ocean restoration through sales partnership
- Welcomes players of all backgrounds with accessible, inclusive design

**Core Pillars:**
1. Restoration is Rewarding
2. Science-Grounded Fantasy
3. Community Impact
4. Cozy Complexity
5. Legacy & Hope
