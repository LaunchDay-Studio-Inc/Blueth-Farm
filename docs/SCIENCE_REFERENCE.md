## What is Blue Carbon?

### Definition
**Blue Carbon** refers to carbon captured and stored by coastal and marine ecosystems, particularly in the biomass and sediments of vegetated coastal habitats like seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and mangrove forests.

### Why "Blue" Carbon?
The term distinguishes ocean-based carbon sequestration ("blue") from terrestrial forest-based sequestration ("green"). Blue carbon ecosystems are among the most efficient carbon sinks on Earth despite covering less than 2% of the ocean surface.

### Importance for Climate Change

**Exceptional Sequestration Rates:**
- Blue carbon ecosystems sequester carbon 10-50x faster per unit area than terrestrial forests
- They store carbon for millennial timescales (1,000+ years) in anaerobic sediments
- Protected from decomposition by waterlogged, low-oxygen conditions

**Global Carbon Budget:**
- Coastal ecosystems store an estimated 25 billion tonnes of carbon globally
- Account for ~50% of carbon burial in ocean sediments despite small area
- Loss of these ecosystems releases stored carbon back to atmosphere

**Current Crisis:**
- 25-50% of global blue carbon ecosystems lost in past 50 years
- Continued loss rate: 0.5-3% per year
- Lost ecosystems shift from carbon sinks to carbon sources
- Restoration can reverse this trend within years

### Blue vs. Green Carbon

| Feature | Blue Carbon (Coastal) | Green Carbon (Terrestrial) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Sequestration Rate** | 10-50x faster per hectare | Baseline |
| **Storage Duration** | Millennial (1,000+ years) | Decades to centuries |
| **Storage Location** | Primarily in sediment | Primarily in biomass |
| **Carbon Density** | Up to 1,800 t CO₂/hectare | 300-500 t CO₂/hectare |
| **Storage Stability** | Very high (anaerobic) | Vulnerable to fire, decay |
| **Co-benefits** | Coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity | Biodiversity, watershed protection |

### Game Implications
- Players should see faster carbon accumulation than traditional tree-planting games
- Sediment storage creates long-term, stable carbon reserves
- Ecosystem loss should be dramatic (carbon release)
- Restoration shows rapid results (positive feedback)

## Key Ecosystems & Carbon Sequestration

### 1. Seagrass Meadows

**Carbon Sequestration Rate:** ~138 tonnes CO₂/km²/year  
**Global Area:** ~300,000 km² (declining)  
**Carbon Storage:** ~4,200-8,400 tonnes CO₂/km² total stored

**How They Store Carbon:**
- **Biomass:** Leaves, roots, rhizomes store carbon short-term (years)
- **Sediment Trapping:** Dense meadows slow water flow, trap particles
- **Root Systems:** Extensive below-ground roots sequester carbon in sediment
- **Long-Term Storage:** Organic matter buried in anoxic sediments persists for millennia

**Depth & Distribution:**
- Found from intertidal zones to ~90m depth (light-dependent)
- Optimal: 0-10m depth with high light penetration
- Prefer sandy to muddy substrates
- Require clear water (turbidity limits photosynthesis)

**Key Scientific Facts:**
- Seagrass meadows cover 0.1% of ocean floor but store 11% of ocean carbon burial
- Can sequester carbon 35x faster than tropical rainforests per unit area
- Store carbon up to 2 meters deep in sediment
- Mature meadows (100+ years) store more carbon than young ones

**Game Mechanics:**
- Early-game ecosystem (easy to plant, fast visual feedback)
- Carbon storage increases with meadow age and density
- Clear water requirement creates gameplay challenge
- Sediment quality affects growth rate and carbon storage

### 2. Salt Marshes

**Carbon Sequestration Rate:** ~218 tonnes CO₂/km²/year  
**Global Area:** ~55,000 km²  
**Carbon Storage:** ~8,000-22,000 tonnes CO₂/km² total stored

**How They Store Carbon:**
- **Peat Formation:** Partially decomposed plant matter accumulates as peat
- **Sediment Accretion:** Marshes trap sediment, building elevation over time
- **Deep Storage:** Peat can extend 5+ meters deep, storing thousands of years of carbon
- **Vertical Growth:** Marshes build upward, keeping pace with sea level rise

**Tidal Requirements:**
- Intertidal zone (flooded at high tide, exposed at low tide)
- Salinity tolerance varies by species (brackish to full seawater)
- Tidal flushing brings nutrients and removes toxins
- Hydroperiod (flooding duration) critical for species zonation

**Key Scientific Facts:**
- Salt marshes store carbon 5 meters deep (vs. 0.5m for terrestrial soils)
- Can store carbon for over 2,000 years
- Accrete sediment faster than sea level rise (under healthy conditions)
- Provide nitrogen removal (water quality benefit)

**Zonation:**
- **Low Marsh:** Frequently flooded, Spartina alterniflora dominant
- **Mid Marsh:** Intermediate flooding, diverse species
- **High Marsh:** Infrequently flooded, Spartina patens, Juncus

**Game Mechanics:**
- Tidal timing crucial for planting windows
- Elevation management (sediment building gameplay)
- Hydrological connectivity important
- Long-term carbon accumulation visible through sediment cores

### 3. Mangrove Forests

**Carbon Sequestration Rate:** ~226 tonnes CO₂/km²/year  
**Global Area:** ~138,000 km²  
**Carbon Storage:** ~20,000-40,000 tonnes CO₂/km² total stored

**How They Store Carbon:**
- **Above-Ground Biomass:** Massive woody trees store substantial carbon
- **Below-Ground Roots:** Extensive prop roots create dense structure
- **Sediment Storage:** Root systems trap sediment, create anoxic conditions
- **Peat Formation:** Can form deep peat deposits (up to 5+ meters)

**Habitat Requirements:**
- Tropical and subtropical coastlines (frost-sensitive)
- Brackish to full salinity tolerance
- Sheltered coastlines (low wave energy)
- Tidal influence (but not constant immersion)

**Key Scientific Facts:**
- Mangroves store 3-5x more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests
- 50-90% of mangrove carbon is in below-ground sediments
- Can store carbon 1,000+ years
- Support 1,300+ species globally
- Reduce wave energy by up to 66% (coastal protection)

**Species Zonation (by salinity tolerance):**
- **Seaward:** Red mangrove (Rhizophora) — highest salinity tolerance
- **Mid-Zone:** Black mangrove (Avicennia) — salt-excreting leaves
- **Landward:** White mangrove (Laguncularia) — lowest salinity

**Game Mechanics:**
- Longest growth cycles (years to maturity)
- Highest total carbon storage potential
- Dramatic coastal protection during storms
- Nursery habitat for commercial fish (economic benefit)
- Requires precise salinity and tidal conditions

### 4. Kelp Forests

**Carbon Sequestration:** Variable, primarily through carbon export  
**Global Area:** ~7,000,000 km² (estimates vary)  
**Unique Carbon Pathway:** Export-based rather than direct burial

**How They Store Carbon:**
- **Biomass Production:** Fast-growing (up to 30cm/day for giant kelp)
- **Carbon Export:** Drifting kelp transports carbon to deep ocean
- **Deep-Sea Deposition:** Some kelp sinks to depths where carbon is sequestered
- **Food Web:** Supports species that sequester carbon (e.g., fish)

**Habitat Requirements:**
- Cool, nutrient-rich waters (temperate/polar regions)
- Rocky substrate for holdfast attachment
- Depths 5-30m typically
- Strong light penetration required

**Key Scientific Facts:**
- Giant kelp (Macrocystis) can grow up to 60m tall
- Kelp forests among most productive ecosystems on Earth
- ~11% of kelp production may reach deep ocean (long-term storage)
- Support 1,000+ species in kelp forest ecosystems
- Sea otters critical for kelp health (control urchin populations)

**Trophic Cascade:**
- Sea otters eat urchins → urchins controlled → kelp forests thrive
- Without otters, urchin populations explode → overgraze kelp → "urchin barrens"

**Game Mechanics:**
- Requires boat access (deeper water)
- Urchin population management critical
- Carbon pathway different from other ecosystems (less direct sediment storage)
- Fast growth provides satisfying visual feedback
- Sea otter reintroduction as major gameplay milestone
